A snake game I hacked together in Python using curses.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xqb64/snake.py pysnake
cd pysnake
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install .
```

## Tests

To run tests, mypy checks, and style checks, you need to have Pythons:

- 3.10
- 3.11
- 3.12

For installing all the Python versions, I recommend [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

Once you have them, run:

```
tox
```
